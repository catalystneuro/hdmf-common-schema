datasets:
- data_type_def: EnumData
  data_type_inc: VectorData
  dtype: uint8
  doc: Data that come from a fixed set of values. A data value of i corresponds
    to the i-th value in the VectorData referenced by the 'elements' attribute.
  attributes:
  - name: elements
    dtype:
      target_type: VectorData
      reftype: object
    doc: Reference to the VectorData object that contains the enumerable elements

datasets:
- data_type_def: MeasurementData
  data_type_inc: VectorData
  dtype: numeric
  doc: Data that are stored according to one dtype, but can be coerced by a
    scaling factor and offset into another dtype representing the true units
    of the measurement.
  attributes:
  - name: unit
    dtype: text
    doc: Base unit of measurement for working with the data.
      Actual stored values are not necessarily stored in these units.
      To access the data in these units, add the 'offset' to the 'data'
      and multiply by the 'conversion'.
  - name: offset
    dtype: numeric
      target_type: VectorData
      reftype: object
    doc: Factor that is added to shift the values of the stored data prior to scaling.
  - name: conversion
    dtype: numeric
      target_type: VectorData
      reftype: object
    doc: Scalar multiple applied to all data shifted by offset.
