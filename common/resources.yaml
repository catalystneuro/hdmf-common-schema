 - data_type_def: ResourceReferences
   doc: A table for identifying which objects in a file contain
        values that correspond to external resource references. An
        external resource reference takes the form of an *id*, which
        is resolvable within a reference. Some of examples are
        GO:0005524, an entry in the Genome Ontology, ABE-0008876, an entry
        in the ASAP microbial genome database, or MGI:88294, an entry in the
        Mouse Genome Informatics database.
